                <h1 class="motto">"Smother transition from High School to College or University" is our Motto</h1>
                <h2 class="probs">One of the leading problems in Ethiopia for Collage applicants is not having the necessary knowledge when applying for Collage and Universities and misinformation about the pre-application stuff that needs to be done. the CAH can fully prevent this problem by making students plan their application as early as starting from grade 9. This enables them to be more prepared for the application and gain higher chances of success in their following lives.</h2>
